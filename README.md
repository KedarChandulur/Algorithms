# Algorithms_Repo

Algorithms are written in C++.
Project can be opened in visual studio or src files can be copied seperatly into your project.

If you are using visual studio, include the relavent files into the project. 
For example to test any greedy algorithm, include that file in visual studio solution explorer and exclude all other files, this has to be done currently cause all the files have a main function seperatly.

Algorithms written so far:
- Quick Sort Algorithm - Quicksort.cpp
- Split Multiply Algorithm - Splitmultiply.cpp
- Catalan Algorithm Memoized - CatalanMM.cpp
- Catalan Algorithm Non-Memoized - CatalanTD.cpp
- Greedy Algorithm for minimal number of bills(calculated based on the denomination - Ex denomination: 1, 4, 7, 13, 28, 52, 91, 365) - GreedyAlgorithm.cpp
- Maximum profit algorithm (Maximum profit in a 5 x 5 array (25 elements or less)) - MPP.cpp
